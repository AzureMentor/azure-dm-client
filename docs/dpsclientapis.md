# Dps client library APIs

#### InitializeDpsClient
<pre>HRESULT InitializeDpsClient()</pre>
Initialises dps client. Internally initializes Urchin objects to work with TPM.
  Note that this API must be called before using dps client api's.

#### GetEndorsementKeyPub
<pre>HRESULT DeinitializeDpsClient()</pre>
Unitialize dps client. Internally deinitialize Urchin objects that were created as part InitializeDpsClient().
    Note that this API must be called in clean up portion of using dps client api's.

#### GetEndorsementKeyPub
<pre>HRESULT GetEndorsementKeyPub(
    _Out_writes_bytes_all_(*pcbekPub) PBYTE ekPub,
    _Inout_ UINT32 *pcbekPub
)</pre>
Read TPM endorsement key public value.

| Parameter | Description |
|----|----|
|   ekPub  |  - user has to pass sufficient byte buffer to store public value of endorsement key. On succesful reading, buffer will be updated with endorsement key public value.|
|  pcbekPub| - user has to pass count of passed buffer. On successful reading, it updates with actual endorsement key public value byte count.|
|  returns | S_OK on successful reading and other relavant error code for failure.|

#### GetRegistrationId
<pre>HRESULT GetRegistrationId(
    __out_ecount_z(*pcchregistrationId) PWSTR registrationId,
    _Inout_ size_t *pcchRegistrationId
)
</pre>

Get device registration id by reading TPM. This is needed to upload the device information to azure dps service.

| Parameter | Description |
|----|----|
|    registrationId | user has to pass sufficient WCHAR buffer to store device registration id. On succesful reading, buffer will be updated with device registration id.|
|    pcchRegistrationId | user has to pass size of passed WCHAR buffer. On successful reading, it updates with actual device registration id size.|
|    returns | S_OK on successful reading and other relavant error code for failure.|

#### IsDeviceProvisionedInAzure
<pre>HRESULT IsDeviceProvisionedInAzure(
    UINT32 tpmSlotNumber,
    _Out_ bool *provisioned
)
</pre>

Reads TPM logical slot and check whether the azure connection string is already provisioned in it or not.
Note that it does not validate by communicating with Azure services.

| Parameter | Description |
|----|----|
|    tpmSlotNumber | user has to pass logical tpm slot number to check for azure connection string.|
|    provisioned | user has to pass bool pointer to provisioned. It will be updated with true if connection string present in TPM else updated with false.|
|    returns | S_OK on successful reading and other relavant error code for failure.|

#### EmptyTpmSlot
<pre>HRESULT EmptyTpmSlot(UINT32 tpmSlotNumber)</pre>
 Erases data stored in specified TPM logical slot.

| Parameter | Description |
|----|----|
|    tpmSlotNumber | user has to pass TPM logical slot number to erase data.| 
|    returns | S_OK on successful reading and other relavant error code for failure.|

#### GetAzureConnectionString
<pre>HRESULT GetAzureConnectionString(
    __in UINT32 tpmSlotNumber,
    __in DWORD expiryDurationInSeconds,
    _In_opt_ PCWSTR moduleId,
    __out_ecount_z(*pcchConnectionString) PWSTR connectionString,
    _Inout_ size_t *pcchConnectionString
)
</pre>
Get azure connection string(SAS token based) by reading the hostage key and service url stored in TPM.

| Parameter | Description |
|----|----|
|    tpmSlotNumber | user has pass tpm logical slot number to read hostage key and service url.|
|    expiryDurationInSeconds | user has to pass sas token expiry duration in seconds.|
|    moduleId | Currently this is not implemented.|
|    connectionString | User has to pass sufficient WCHAR buffer to store the azure connection string. On successful reading buffer will be updated with sas token based azure connection string.|
|    pcchConnectionString | User has to pass the WCHAR buffer count of azure connection string. On successful reading, it will be updated with actual buffer count of the returned azure connection string.|
|    returns | S_OK on successful reading and other relavant error code for failure.|

#### AzureDpsRegisterDevice
<pre>HRESULT AzureDpsRegisterDevice(
    UINT32 tpmSlotNumber,
    const std::wstring dpsUri,
    const std::wstring dpsScopeId
)
</pre>
Register the device with IotHub by using azure dps service.

Pre-requisite:
Before using this API, you need to sign up with azure and subscribe to IotHub & DPS and upload the device information to DPS service. Please see ReadMe of the repo for more details.


| Parameter | Description |
|----|----|
|   tpmSlotNumber | user has to pass TPM slot number to store the key.|
|   dpsUri | user has to pass azure device provisioning service global end point.|
|   dpsScopeId | user has to pass customer dps scope id. You can get this information from azure portal dps service->overview->id scope.|
|   returns | S_OK on successful reading and other relavant error code for failure.|
